How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Modularity is important when trying to make maintainable code. The CRUD code in my animal_shelter.py file is an example of this. Each aspect of CRUD is clearly separated and commented. This module could easily be adapted to be used for managing any number of different databases. That is because the code is clearly broken down into its pieces.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Itâ€™s important to clearly define project requirements. This is crucial in system analysis and design. Doing so helps us establish how the pieces of the project will work together to achieve the goal of the program. This was the first class I took that required combining front-end and back-end. This required understanding how each portion of the project fit into the system as a whole. For Grazioso Salvare in particular, I thought it was important to understand how this program would be utilized (searching shelter databases for potential dogs) to figure out how to best present the information to the user. In the future, I will have a better comprehension of the whole picture and will more easily be able to combine pieces of a project.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?

Computer scientists use their knowledge of the way computers think to develop programs that improve other systems. For Grazioso Salvare, this essentially means that a computer scientist's goal was to make the company able to filter and better analyze the demographics of their shelter. The efficiency of utilizing a database with a dashboard will drastically improve their ability to find dogs. This will have a large-scale impact because it will allow Grazioso Salvare to provide service/rescue dogs to others more easily.
